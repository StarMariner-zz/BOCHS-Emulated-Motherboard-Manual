# BOCHS-Emulated-Motherboard-Manual
Simply BOCHS Software representation of a Hardware Motherboard with intgrated CPU, GPU , Sound and memory

The idea is WIP work in Progress. I hope to mimic a paper manual that shows the parts in an emulated BOCHS machine. The parts can be swapped out ect..
WHY? Because I can. I think it will help visualize what is essentially a hidden architecture . As a hardware enthusiast myself I like to see things with pins on.

At Present this is completly un official, it's sort of Fan-ware.
